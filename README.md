This project is developed as a capstone project from Algoritma Academy Data Analytics Specialization with a simple webscrapping case and how to visualise the data with plots

Web Scraping is the process of downloading data from websites and extracting valuable information from the data.

At this project, i will do a web scrapping method using BeautifulSoup. I scrap exchange rate Indonesian Rupiahs (IDR) per US Dollar (USD) data's from https://www.exchange-rates.org/history/IDR/USD/T

Exchange-Rates.org allows us to check the latest foreign exchange rates. Data on the website is up-to-date and provided by one of the financial leaders. I will scrap historical exchange rates data the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and the US Dollar (USD) between 4/4/2022 and 9/30/2022. The data consist of the value of 1 USD in IDR with date and price per day.
